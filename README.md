# Final Fantasy IIV Trivia Game
A timed trivia game with multiple choice questions about Final Fantasy VII. Stylish bootstrap with intense background video, javaScript for the logic, and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Be sure to layout this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.
The entire trivia game is contained within a traslucent div for easier video enjoyment. Game history is also a clickable link within the div.

The page uses jQuery and the JavaScript `setInterval()` function to countdown from 1 minute, timing the quiz.
